# Event Guest Manager - Developer Test

Welcome! 👋

This is a take-home coding test where you'll work with a full-stack event management application.

## 📋 What You'll Build

Your task is to **design and implement a public RSVP page** where guests can register for an event.

You'll be working with:
- **Backend**: Go + PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Svelte 5 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Docker)

## NOTE: Feel free to use any tools at your disposal  but we highly value understanding of the code which is written 

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Setup
Read **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)** for installation and setup instructions.

### Step 2: Understand the Task  
Read **[TASK.md](TASK.md)** for detailed requirements and what to build.

### Step 3: Start Coding
Build the RSVP page, fix any issues you encounter, and document your work.

### Step 4: Submit
Complete **[SUBMISSION.md](SUBMISSION.md)** with your findings and submit your code.

## ⏱️ Time Estimate

**24-48 hours** depending on your experience level.

## 🎯 What We're Looking For

- **Working code** - Does it function as specified?
- **Code quality** - Clean, readable, and maintainable
- **Problem-solving** - Can you identify and fix issues?
- **Design skills** - Is the RSVP page well-designed and user-friendly?
- **Documentation** - Clear explanation of your work

## 💡 Important Note

The existing codebase is functional but may have some issues. Part of this test is discovering and fixing problems as you go - just like in real-world development!
